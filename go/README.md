# AWS Secrets Go Example

This example shows how an application could access secrets from AWS parameter store in Go. It assumes the following:

- There is an encrypted secret already located at `/app/some-secret`
- The secret is encrypted with the default SSM KMS key
- The secret is in the same AWS region as this app is being run against

## Quick Start

Run the following to see the example in action:

```sh
go run -mod=vendor main.go
```

Your secret should print on the screen at one second intervals. It will remain
cached for 10 second periods (in production you'd be better using a larger
value). Change the secret while the application is running, and you'll see the
secret change when the app refreshes its cached value.
